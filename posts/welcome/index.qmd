```{r,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
#| label: tbl-data-description
# Filter out EPs and albums without Metacritic scores if needed
album_data <- taylor_albums %>%
  filter(!ep) %>%  # Exclude EPs
  select(album_name, ep, album_release, metacritic_score, user_score)

# Create the interactive datatable
datatable(
  album_data,
  options = list(
    pageLength = 10,       # Number of rows per page
    autoWidth = TRUE,      # Automatically adjust column widths
    searching = TRUE,      # Enable search box
    ordering = TRUE,       # Enable column ordering
    lengthChange = TRUE,   # Allow users to change the number of rows displayed
    pagingType = "simple_numbers", # Type of pagination controls
    scrollX = TRUE         # Enable horizontal scrolling
  ),
  caption = htmltools::tags$caption(
    style = 'caption-side: top; text-align: left; font-weight: bold; font-size: 120%;',
    'Table 1: Overview of Taylor Swift Albums'
  ),
  rownames = FALSE,         # Hide row names
  class = 'cell-border stripe' # Add some styling
)

```
Notes:

EP: Indicates whether the release is an Extended Play (TRUE) or a full album (FALSE).
Metacritic Score: An aggregate score out of 100, reflecting the critical reception based on reviews from mainstream publications.
User Score: A score out of 10, representing the average rating given by users on Metacritic.


## Understanding Metacritic and User Scores

#### Metacritic Score
The Metacritic Score is a weighted average of reviews from top-tier critics and publications. It provides a comprehensive view of an album's critical reception. Scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more favorable reviews. For instance, a Metacritic Score of 90 suggests universal acclaim, while a score below 60 may indicate mixed or unfavorable reviews.

#### User Score
The User Score is an average rating submitted by users on Metacritic. Unlike the Metacritic Score, which aggregates professional critics' reviews, the User Score reflects the general audience's perception. Scores range from 0 to 10, with higher scores signifying greater user satisfaction. This metric helps gauge how well an album resonates with the broader fanbase.

The absolute value of these for both the original and the re-released albums can be seen in @tbl-data-description.
