    "text": "Understanding Metacritic and User Scores\n\nMetacritic Score\nThe Metacritic Score is a weighted average of reviews from top-tier critics and publications. It provides a comprehensive view of an album’s critical reception. Scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more favorable reviews. For instance, a Metacritic Score of 90 suggests universal acclaim, while a score below 60 may indicate mixed or unfavorable reviews.\n\n\nUser Score\nThe User Score is an average rating submitted by users on Metacritic. Unlike the Metacritic Score, which aggregates professional critics’ reviews, the User Score reflects the general audience’s perception. Scores range from 0 to 10, with higher scores signifying greater user satisfaction. This metric helps gauge how well an album resonates with the broader fanbase.\nThe absolute value of these for both the original and the re-released albums can be seen in Table 1."
