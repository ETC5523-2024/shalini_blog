When I’m not unlocking hidden insights from data, I’m often exploring the boundless world of art and music.\nI love getting lost in the melodies of diverse genres, diving deep into the visual storytelling of anime, and binge-watching K-dramas, which fuel both my creative and analytical sides.\nFun fact: I speak four languages, and that makes experiencing global cultures through music and media even more enriching!\nWelcome to my world—where creativity meets data, and every detail has a story to tell."
